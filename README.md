By using clear variable names and including coherent comments, I ensure that my code is easily readable. I apply object orriented coding approaches to allow my code to be maintainable and adaptable. The CRUD Python module developed is called AnimalShelter.py, but it can be used with any MongoDB database. When creating the AnimalShelter object, a username, password, database, and colleciton can be passed. This makes the code reusable for other applications. This was my first time utilizing a MongoDB database, so my approach to the requirements was different than in other assignments. Thanks to MongoDB use of documents, the design of the database was simpler than if it had been made in SQL. Computer scientists take customer requirements and turn them into usable software.
